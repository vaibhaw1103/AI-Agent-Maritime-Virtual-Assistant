# 🆓 **FREE Marine Map Setup - No API Keys Required!**

## 🎉 **Problem Solved!**

You no longer need Mapbox API keys or any payment information. I've created a **completely free marine map** using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.

## 🗺️ **What You Get (100% Free):**

- ✅ **Professional Marine Map** with nautical styling

## 🚀 **How It Works:**

The new `FreeMarineMap` component uses:
